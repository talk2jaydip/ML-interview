    "**Example:**  \n",
    "The abrupt changes in consumer behavior brought on by COVID-19 had a major impact on the accuracy of forecasting models that rely on historical data to inform their predictions. This can be treated as an example of concept drift.\n",
    "\n",
    "**One of the main reasons for concept drift to occur is the non-stationarity of data i.e., change in statistical properties of data with time.**\n",

    "- This means that even though the relationship between feature and target variable remains unchanged, the distribution of the feature itself has changed.\n",
    "> **Example**: Suppose a model is trained with a salary variable that ranges from 200$ to 300$ and is in production. Over time, salary increases and the model encounters real-time data with higher salary figures of 1000$,1200$, and so on. And the model will see an increase in mean and variance, and therefore it leads to a data drift.\n",
