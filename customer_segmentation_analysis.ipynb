    "\t\t- Recency: how fresh the customer made a purchase?\n",
    "\t       \n",
    "\t   -   Frequency: how frequent the customer made a purchase?\n",
    "\t       \n",
    "\t   -   Monetary: how much money did the customer spend on average?\n",
    "    > RFMresult give you a summary for each customers on Recency Frequency Monetary. Then we can apply different cutoff to do customer segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I use the following cutoffs:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Recency: most recent purchase is within 3 month, 3 - 6 month, and over 6 month\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Frequency: new customers (only made 1 purchase so far), frequent customers (2-5 purchases), and very frequent customers (more than 5 purchases)\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Monetary: Use p10, p50 and p90 as cutoffs\n",
    "-   **purchase pattern** mining using Market Basket Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "> For a specific RFM group, we want to recommend product to customers based on their purchase patterns. To achieve this, we run **Market basket analysis** to find out what products are frequently purchased together.\n",
    "`, Market Basket Analysis identifies purchasing patterns: purchased item X => also purchase item Y.`\n",
    "\n",
    " - The support measures how frequently X and Y are purchased together. \n",
    " - The confidence is the frequency of purchasing X and Y together\n",
    "   dividing the frequency of purchasing X.\n",
    "- Confidence equals to 1 means that if customer purchased X, they definitely purchased Y.  And the  lift the the support of purchasing X and Y together over support of X\n",
    "   and support of Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Market basket analysis is a method to gain insights into granular behavior of customers. This is helpful in devising strategies which uncovers deeper understanding of purchase decisions taken by the customers.`\n",
    "\n",
    " -   **potential customers** identification for a given product\n",
    "\t\t>  After you identify the purchasing pattern, say purchased X and also purchased Y, potential customers of product Y can be identified as customers who purchased product X but haven't purchased product Y.\n",

    "## **Customer Segmentation Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Demographic Segmentation Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "Demographic segmentation means dividing people into groups based on certain demographic factors, including age, income, marital status, and occupation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Geographic Segmentation Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "With geographic segmentation, you categorize your audience based on where they work, live, and shop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Psychographic Segmentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "We each have unique personalities, but we share traits or characteristics. Psychographic segmentation means forming groups based on common traits such as hobbies, lifestyle choices, personality traits, cultural beliefs, and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Technographic Segmentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Technographic segmentation means categorizing people depending on the devices, hardware, and software they use. Why does this data matter? Well, according to  [statistics](https://www.outerboxdesign.com/web-design-articles/mobile-ecommerce-statistics):\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Behavioral Segmentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Want to know how your audience interacts with your business? Try behavioral segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Needs-Based Segmentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Successful marketing often comes down to showing prospects how your goods or services meet their needs. That’s where needs-based segmentation comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Techniques of Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Segmentation to identify the type of customers **who would respond to a particular offer**\n",
    "-   Segmentation to identify **high spenders among customers** who will use the e-commerce channel for festive shopping\n",
    "-   Segmentation to identify customers **who will default on their credit** obligation for a loan or credit card\n",
    "\n",
    "> The most common techniques used for building an `objective segmentation are CHAID and CRT`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these techniques attempt to maximize the difference among segments with regards to the stated objective (sometimes referred to as the target for segmentation). \n",
    "\n",
    "`CHAID uses a chi square statistic for the same while CRT uses Gini impurity`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Objective Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Segmentation of the customer base to understand the specific profiles which exist within the customer base so that **multiple marketing actions** can be personalized for each segment\n",
    "-   Segmentation of geographies on the basis of **affluence and lifestyle of people living in each geograph**y so that sales and distribution strategies can be formulated accordingly\n",
    "-   Segmentation of **web site visitors on the basis of browsing behavior** to understand the level of engagement and affinity towards the brand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ## What is Cohort and Cohort Analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "- `A cohort is a group of people sharing something in common, such as the sign-up date to an app, the month of the first purchase, geographical location, acquisition channel (organic users, coming from performance marketing, etc.) and so on.`\n",
    "- Cohort analysis is a descriptive analytics technique in cohort analysis. Customers are divided into mutually exclusive cohorts, which are then tracked over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t- Customer Lifetime Value\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer lifetime value is how much money a customer will bring your brand throughout their entire time as a paying customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Time cohorts: customers who signed up for a product or service during a particular time frame.`Groups are divided by first activity.`\n",
    "-   Behavior cohorts: customers who purchased a product or subscribed to service in the past.\n",
    "-   Size cohorts: refer to the various sizes of customers who purchase the company’s products or services.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **_this process is the acquisition month cohort for each customer i.e. we have assigned the acquisition month cohort to each customer._**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **_will be cohortIndex i.e, the difference between “TransactionMonth ” and “CohortMonth” in terms of the number of months and call the column “cohortIndex”._**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Retention measures how many customers from each of the cohort have returned in the subsequent months.\n",
